# Twicorder - A simple twitter recorder using Twitter Python Libraries

## What is this project about?
This project is basically a utility that can be used for collecting data from twitter. The code, hopefully, will
include the following capabilities:
 - [ ] Streaming public tweets from Twitter
 - [ ] Handling rate limiting issues
 - [ ] Storing all the data in a CSV, or some other form (TBD)

## Organization of the code
All the relevant stuff should be in the the [source folder](https://github.com/syedshabihhasan/Twicorder/tree/master/src).
